## CONDITION OF RAILWAY TRACKS

The project is a poc for railway monitoring system which detects faults before they intensify and improve the safety. Various
combination of sensors and an inspection bot are used for this purpose. Crack detection, Mud hole detection, Obstacle detection and
Interlocking of tracks are some of the faults detected by the inspection bot.This system proved to be reliable one. By using 
ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge sensor the most common faults encountered were successfully sensed and an alert message was sent. 

We intend to improvise this system by using high end sensors like RFID passive sensors. In case of obstacle detection,automatic brake 
system can be incorporated along with the proposed technique.In future we plan to incorporate IoT technology for condition monitoring of 
railway tracks and make the proposed system a smarter and more efficient one.

**IN THIS REPO:**
This repo consits of a ppt which describes the poc, a video explaining the poc and the arduino program used for programming the sensor. It
also consists the poster presented in the IISF. We are open to feedback and constructive criticism :)
